# Analysis Code for Error-Correction Learning Study

This repository contains the code for the analyses reported in:

> Mackiewicz, J., Milin, P., & Divjak, D. (2025). Error-correction 
learning of second language verbal morphology: Associating imperfect 
contingencies in naturalistic frequency 
distributions. *Language Learning* (forthcoming).

## Scripts

- `01_data_prep_for_BayesABtest.R`: Prepares the data and examines 
differences during training between the two groups, 
separately for grammatical and ungrammatical items, and across 
training days.  
- `02_posttest_analyses.R`: Analyses post-test results by modelling 
individual responses (correct/incorrect) with Generalised Linear 
Mixed-Effects Models for binary outcomes, and by using log-linear 
models to analyse multiway contingency tables and reveal group-level 
tendencies.  
- `03_posttest_sdt.R`: Implements the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) 
framework to analyse participantsâ€™ response strategies.  
- `04_by_participant_SDT.R`: Applies the SDT framework at the 
individual level, providing a more fine-grained view of response 
strategies.  

## Data

The data are available from the University of Birmingham 
Institutional Research Archive (UBIRA):
